## Contributing

This project is in its very early days and we will always be welcoming
contributors.

Our goal is to encourage frictionless contributions to the project. In order to
achieve that, we use Unprotocols [C4 process](https://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:1/C4).
Please read it, it will answer a lot of questions. Our goal is to merge pull requests
as quickly as possible and make new stable releases regularly.

In a nutshell, this means:

* We merge pull requests rapidly (try!)
* We are open to diverse ideas
* We prefer code now over consensus later
